Using the included UTF-8 `key`, construct a JSON array using the lowercase hex digest of the blake2b hash for each trait (digest size=64). POST this bare array back to this endpoint. Example array: [\"1f9ec19c7...57fd27e5\", \"79c72b47088...bf13026c\", ...] If the hashes are correct you will get a Verification ID you should include in your application. 400 responses indicate a problem with the hashes in your array. Note, the key rotates each day around midnight EST."
